**1. Download single cell metadata**

 Since single cell metadatas take on different data types including .mtx, .csv and .tsv, an integrated downloading process is efficient for further research. Below are brief processes to download the desired data, respectively.

 In Case of .mtx (mostly from 2020 or later), follow A.
 For .tsv, follow B-1 through 3. For .csv, skip B-2. Concatenation takes considerable data storage. When it comes short, don't follow B-4. Otherwise follow B-4 to merge data into one.

 WARNING : Always set raw_dir in /contents/, not in your drive. It may cause undesirable storage overflow.

**2. Preprocess**

1. Mygene annotation
(Optional : 1-1. Annotation sanity check)
2. QC (Basic mt/rps/hb HVG subset) + Basic downstream pre-scVI
3. Setup SCVI model on HVGs

*Logs*

20251020 Create RERUN_PREPROCESS : Unpack .tar.gz to read and concatenate.

20251020 Revise ANNOTATE_MYGENE : Fix logic flow & memory efficiency. Drop sanity check : ~30% of dropout is allowed

20251020 Revise SCVI_SETUP : Fix learning parameters. Reduce keys to prevent overfitting

20251025 Revise HVG SELECTION : Subset hvgs first before scVI for robust results

20251102 Creat QC_SCHEME : Remove outlier cells/genes with 3MAD rule
(filter cell/gene -> MT/RPS/HB/total counts/pct counts masking)

20251108 FIx QC_SCHEME : Manual filter_cells/genes to save memory

20251216 Refactoring : fixed code flow and cleared paths
